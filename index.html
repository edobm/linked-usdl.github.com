        <h3>Welcome to Linked-USDL.org</h3>

<p>Linked USDL aims to better promote and support the use of the Unified Service Description Language (USDL) on the Web. USDL is a platform-neutral language for describing services consolidated from SAP Research projects. The kinds of services targeted for coverage by USDL include human services (e.g., consultancy), business services (e.g. purchase order requisition), software services (e.g., WSDL and RESTful services), infrastructure services (e.g., CPU and storage services), etc.</p>

<p>Linked USDL is a remodelled version of USDL that builds upon the Linked Data principles and the Web of Data. This effort is therefore most concerned with remodelling the existing USDL specification as an RDF(S) vocabulary that could better support machines in trading services on the Web. To maximise the potential interoperability Linked USDL adopts, where possible, existing RDF(S) vocabularies such as GoodRelations, the Minimal Service Model and FOAF to name a few. Linked USDL is inline with other Linked Data centric initiatives around services such as the work on Linked Services. </p>

<p>The work on Linked USDL was initiated within the W3C USDL Incubator Group as a joint effort between the Knowledge Media Institute of The Open University, and SAP Research. Through this site we hope that others might either benefit from or contribute to this effort.</p>
